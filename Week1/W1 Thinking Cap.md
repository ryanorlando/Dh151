A web mapping site that I found was National Geographic's Mapmaker Interactive site, which can be found at https://mapmaker.nationalgeographic.org/#/. 
The initial page when you first open up the site looks like this:

This mapping site aims to provide an educational and interactive experience with global maps of different aspects of nature, culture, and history. It can map 
things ranging from gray wolf populations to geothermal energy to displaced human populations. What makes this mapping site very intriguing is the 
fact that it can layer these different maps on top of one another, allowing for analysis and comparisons between different sets of data. From what I can tell 
based on the structure and information on the site, the main agenda is education, particularly on environmental and human rights issues. Using this mapping site 
was easy, and all the functions appeared to work as they were supposed to. Moreover, it was actually very useful, as it was possible to change layer transparency and the order 
of all the layers. Each layer also came with a pre-made legend, and it was easy to interact with them. Overall, I think the site functions very well.
This mapping site was created using a program called Esri, which I do not know anything about yet, but it appears that it is just a map hosting site. If I could change something 
about this site, I would want to be able to continue to add more maps! I think this is a great educational tool, and if the creators continued to add more information, this site 
can be even better. In addition, I think it would be a good function to be able to change the colors associated with each layer, instead of just the transparency. Some of the colors 
tended to overlap, making those layers blend together unless the transparency settings were altered. Ultimately, I really enjoyed interacting with this site, and I think it is a 
great tool to use for education.
