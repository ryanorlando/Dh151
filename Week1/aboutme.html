        <h1> About Me </h1>

        <p> 
            Hi! My name is Ryan Orlando. I am a third year student at <b> UCLA </b>, majoring in Political Science with a double 
            minor in Digital Humanities and Public Affairs. I am from San Diego, California, where I have lived my whole life. 
            At <b> UCLA </b>, I am involved in several different extracurricular activities, but the one that takes up the most time is my 
            job as a student manager for the <b> UCLA </b> basketball team. This job keeps me occupied with practice and games six days 
            a week, but I love it. When I graduate, I hope to either work in sports or politics, and I am considering going to 
            law school as well. In the little free time I have, I love going to the beach and just being outdoors. 
        </p>

            In this class, I am hoping to learn about web coding, because it seems really useful and when done properly, it can be 
            a great educational and research tool.
