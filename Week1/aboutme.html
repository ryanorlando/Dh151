        <h1> About Me </h1>

        <p> 
            Hi! My name is Ryan Orlando. I am a third year student at <b> UCLA </b>, majoring in <i> Political Science </i> with a double 
            minor in <i> Digital Humanities </i> and <i> Public Affairs</i>. I am from San Diego, California, where I have lived my whole life. 
            At <b> UCLA </b>, I am involved in several different extracurricular activities, but the one that takes up the most time is my 
            job as a student manager for the <b> UCLA </b> basketball team. This job keeps me occupied with practice and games six days 
            a week, but I love it. When I graduate, I hope to either work in sports or politics, and I am considering going to 
            law school as well. In the little free time I have, I love going to the beach, running with my friends' foster dog, and just being outdoors. 
        </p>

            In this class, I am hoping to learn about web coding, because it seems really useful and when done properly, it can be 
            a great educational and research tool. In addition, in previous classes I have learned about digital mapping and how 
            interesting it is, so I am excited to be able to create these mapping sites by myself. I have worked on mapping projects 
            in the past, an example of which can be found here: <a> https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3defcb2c438343d58b035428e3b95fbb</a>. 
            Hopefully this class will give me an opportunity to expand these abilities!
