		Taken from the UCLA Library Digital Archive, this dataset contains the photographs published in the LA Times 
		from 1950-1990. I also used this data for a previous project, so it has been narrowed to these years to condense the data. 
		From the sidebar, click each image to zoom to the location where it was taken and see the caption it was 
		published with, if available. Enjoy!
		
		<p> In addition, a warning: As is often the case when examining historical events, some of these titles and captions 
			contain outdated language and terminology that would now be considered offensive, particularly with regard to minority 
			populations.
